Scala & Functional Programming Essentials - Notes & Exercises

Welcome to my journey through the Scala & Functional Programming Essentials Udemy course by Daniel Ciocîrlan. This repository serves as a central hub for my solutions to exercises and personal insights as I progress through the course.

🚀 About the Course

This course offers a hands-on approach to learning Scala 3, focusing on core programming concepts, functional programming principles, and practical problem-solving. It’s perfect for beginners to Scala or those looking to strengthen their understanding of the language and its ecosystem.

What I’m learning:
    •    Basics of Scala syntax and semantics.
    •    Functional programming concepts (immutability, higher-order functions, etc.).
    •    Collections, pattern matching, and functional abstractions.
    •    Practical exercises to solidify concepts.

🛠 Tools & Setup

Prerequisites
    •    Scala 3 installed on your machine.
You can download it via Scala official site or use sbt.
    •    IDE: IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin or any editor of your choice.

Run Scala Code

Use the sbt console to compile and run Scala code:
    sbt
    > compile
    > run

🏋️ Exercises

I’m solving all exercises provided in the course. You’ll find:
    1.    The problem statement (as comments in the code).
    2.    My approach and reasoning.
    3.    The Scala solution.
